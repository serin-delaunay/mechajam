TODO step 7: mechanics.
    add a very small number of tokens with differing battle mechanics (ie. attack types).
    ensure AI choices have a bare minimum of utility.

TODO step 8: tooltips.
    display tooltips for tokens and attacks on mouseover.

TODO step 9: setup.
    add a second game mode to choose tokens before battle. AI selects randomly.

TODO step 10: cycle.
    after end of combat, go back to setup with some information/tokens preserved.

TODO step 11: compactify.
    replace list of tokens with row of tokens below where attacks appear.

TODO step 12: animate.
    show token/attack contests in stages each turn.
    add controls to show the action in finer-grained steps if desired.

TODO step 13: expand.
    add many more interesting tokens and attacks.
    estimate their value to encourage appropriate AI decisions.

TODO step 14: balance.
    run automated choosing/combats with random tokens to get a better sense of how to proceed.

TODO step 15: polish and build.
    get a .exe so that non-developers can play on windows.
